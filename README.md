<h1> Assignment Description </h1>

An employee class was added with the specifications provided by Maria Boyle.
I have mentioned a few things that need to be changed for future versions:

The Date class does not provide proper date verification. Dates such as 30/02 or 31/04
are currently permitted. Please see my initital Assignmnet for proper handling of
this.

The Name class does not provide proper verification. Special characters and digits are 
currently permitted, as well as too short or long names, please see my initital Assignment
for proper handling of this.

I have introcuded a minimum age of 14 for employee's as per child labour laws. The setDateOfBirth()
from the super class had to be overwritten to ensure that employees can not be younger than 14.

Some extra test cases were provided to ensure most edge cases are covered. 

**IntelliJ was used instead of Eclipse, using Java 11. The project was also renamed to bank (former: Software-Implementation).**
